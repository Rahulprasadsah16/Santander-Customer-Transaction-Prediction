To predict which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. 


This project can help the company in following ways-

 Segmenting customers into small groups and addressing individual customers based on actual behaviors — instead of making assumptions of what makes customers similar to one another, and instead of only looking at aggregated data which hides important facts about individual customers.
In Accurately predicting the future behavior of customers like transaction prediction using predictive customer behavior modeling techniques — instead of just looking in the analysis of historical data.
By some advanced calculation, we can determine which cluster of customers are going to be loyal to the company and the group of customers who are hesitating to make a transaction. By knowing all such information, we can treat each customer group differently. For instance, providing coupons to a group of customers to engage in transactions and rewards to those who are loyal to the company.
